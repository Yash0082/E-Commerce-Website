<br>
### Tech Stack Used:
* XAMPP - Apache Server, MySQL Database, PHP, and Front-end stack.
<br>
##### To use our website:
1. Clone this repo or if you have a zip file of it, then unzip it.
2. In the [config/constants.php] file, replace the constants value with your own database constants.
3. Install XAMPP, While installing it, don't forget to check the checkbox for installing MySQL, Apache Server, and phpmyadmin.
4. Open XAMPP, start Apache server and MySQL.
5. Open a Browser, Type in 'localhost'
6. There, click on 'phpmyadmin' in the navigation pane.
7. On phpmyadmin, import the database file provided in the repo. Note - On importing the database file, select the "Character set of the file: " to be utf-16 and then import it.
